## 💥 if its not broken...
#  break it,
-  then inspect, analyze, understand, fix,
-  then do it again.

- 👀 I’m interested in all things Cyber, Dev, Prog, Code, Comz, sysadmin, engineering, redteam, blueteam, vulnerability testing exploitation mitigation, and ultimately get certified as an ethical hacker.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am attempting to tear a whole in the fabrics of Space Time so that i might summon an ancient Daemon of Absolute Control and Primal Chaos. When this Ritual is Completed the Shadows will dance and the darkness will sing, and the atherael will become corporeal, as the dimensional planes converge.
- 💫 Fun Fact: I love to poke and prob and mess around with linux OS's untill they either push back, scream at me, soft break, hard break, and even temporarily bricking my systems requiring a full disk wipe and rewrite the OS. best way to learn how to fix a borked system is to bork it and then extensively yell at it threaten to send its binary to the void, and then wrestling with it till its put into submission and does as she is told.
- 🏴‍☠️ i have multiple disks with multiple OS across multiple Sets of Hardware otherwise it is not a fun or easy task to fix a broken grub, bad kernel, corrupted DE, login+ kickback loops, and my favorite oops i nuked the /root partition from orbit.
